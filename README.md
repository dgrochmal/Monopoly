# Monopoly
Created in my free time. This implementation does its best to adhere to all Monopoly rules that can be found [here.](http://richard_wilding.tripod.com/monorules.htm#) This project is currently not 100% complete. Current omissions:
* Two players only (eventually 3)
* Not all Chance/Communiity Chest Cards currently perform the disired action
* Houses and Hotel implementation is not 100%
* Implementation is currently very messy and will continue to be updated
